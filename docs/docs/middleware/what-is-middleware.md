# What is middleware?

Middleware allows you to run code on a request before any routes are run. This is useful for things like authentication, header manipulation, and anything else that needs to happen before your routes are handled. 

## router.use()

Middleware is attached by calling the `router.use()` method.

The example below shows how to use middleware to add a header to all requests:

```javascript
router.use((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("x-powered-by", "expressly");
});
```

> ðŸš¨ **Unlike Express**, middleware accept only two arguments, `req` and `res`. **expressly** does away with the `next` function; all errors are caught and handled by [error middleware](error-middleware.md). 

If you only want middleware to run on specific routes, you can pass a path to the middleware:

```javascript
router.use("/api/(.*)", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Got a request to the API!");
});
```

> **expressly** uses [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) to [pattern-match routes](../routing.md#route-matching). This means that your middleware mount paths can contain wildcards and even regular expressions.
